	<p>What is the sky? Well, without getting too into it, it's what you see when you look up. No, when you are outside, you know what i mean.<br>

	<p>The sky is mainly seen as a <b style="color:#2E23A7">blue</b> or sometimes a <b style="color:#444444">black</b> at night. </p>
	<p>The sky goes through a few main colors throughout a day.</p>
	<table style="width:100%">

	<p>The sky's color changes based off of multiple factors. </p>

 <p> They are as follows, in a simple form.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The time of day</li>
  <li>Whatever is in the air at the time</li>
  <li>The spread of particals/ molicules within the autosphere</li>

</ul>  
	<div class="lable">
<h2 style="font: italic">But why is that?</h2>
</div> 
	<p> From what i know, it is something called scattering. Scattering is where the molicules within the air scatter the waves of light, effecting how our eyes see the waves as a color. Sometimes they alter the waves of light or straight up block some making it so only longer waves, such as red or orange, make it through.</p>
